// Package ooxmlpkg provides bounded, in-memory access to the OPC ZIP package
// used by PowerPoint files. It manages parts, relationship parts, content
// types, safe part URI resolution, reachability pruning, and atomic writes.
// It also implements the native PPTX template analyze, scaffold, check, and
// fill pipeline used by the Casibase PowerPoint tools.
//
// The package intentionally does not model PresentationML elements. Callers
// that edit slide, chart, or workbook XML should preserve unknown OOXML
// content and write the resulting bytes back with Package.SetPart.
